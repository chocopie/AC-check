# AC Check

This extension automates the following steps on behalf of the user:

1. Copies URL of current tab.
2. Opens http://AChecker.ca in new tab.
3. Pastes copied URL into Web Page URL field.
4. Clicks on submit button.

Yes, this actually does all that - simulating the manual process. I'm scared to try and streamline it in case I break a server that's not mine. The API didn't seem to do what I wanted, and I didn't want to handle validation myself. This extension is pretty much just to save a bit of manual effort on the user's part. :)
